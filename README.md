# react-redux-shopping-cart
Extending the Redux "shopping-cart" app from the redux docs

[Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Examples.html#shopping-cart)

## Run

* download repo
* go to the project's root directory
* install 
```
npm install
```
* run
```
npm start
```

### Stuff I added:
* 'Only x left!' text under each product so you know how much of an item is in stock.
* Search bar that filters the product list according to what you type in. Each change (keystroke) is an action that gets dispatched
